It finally working. I decided to build a static website/blog to showcase some projects using Jekyll. In hindsight
I should have just gone with github pages, but I went with a page built from github using Travis CI, hosted on a AWS S3
bucket, routed using Route 53 and distribute using CloudFront. To make things harder I decided to change domain
provider during this project, so the site is not on its nice and short url yet. Hopefully this will be resolved
with time as changing name servers can apparently take days. Otherwise the saga will continue as I explore why the site
is not routing correctly...

Addendum 1: It seems like the unresolved DNS makes the .css and about unreachable. I will temporarily change the url and see
if it works.

Addendum 2: It works, I also had to change the permalink to "About" for some reason. The real url ([www.anion.se](http://www.anion.se/)) does not show
the parking page of the old domain provider and that may be a hopeful sign... Fingers crossed.
