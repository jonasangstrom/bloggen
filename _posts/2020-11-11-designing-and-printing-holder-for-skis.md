For boring reasons I hade to clean out the room I store my skis and other not so frequently used
sports equipment in and this was and opportunity to do it in a more clever way. I decided to
design and 3d print wall-mounted holder for the skis.

## About the 3d printer
I bought a cheap
[Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_filament_fabrication#Fused_deposition_modeling)
3d printer (a Creality Ender 3Pro) and I have upgraded it by:

* Replacing the hot end with a Micro Swiss all-metal hot end.
* Replacing the card with a 32 bit Bigtreetech card with quieter stepper motor drivers.
* Adding a BL Touch for auto leveling.
* Connecting to a Rasberry pi 4 running Octopi with a connected camera.
* Enclosing in an IKEA Platsa(?) with a glass door from some other IKEA series. This is nice
because it keeps the heat in and cats and children out.
    - I mounted a fire alarm in the enclosure and put the Power Supply Unit and control panel
    outside (I also replaced the PSU with a quieter fan a quieter model).
* Cable chain, upper with a ball bearing holder for the z-rod and the Hero Me Gen5
cooling system. All printed in orange PETG.

I must say I recommend all these upgrades, especially auto bed leveling (I thought this was an
unnecessary luxury for lazy people, but I have never had problems with bed adhesion since I got it) 
and 32 bit card + quieter fan (it is now possible to work next to the printer while it is printing).

I thought the printer would only be a toy, but it has actually been useful. Other than the ski holder
I have designed and printed, among other thing: a replacement wheel for my dishwasher (in PETG),
replacement parts for broken Venetian blinds, extension for a faucet so my 3 year old can reach it, 
door handle bumpers in TPU and parts for wine rack built with 3d printed PETG and aluminum pipes.

## Designing the holder
I use Autodesk Fusion 360 for CAD because it is free for personal, non-commercial use.
