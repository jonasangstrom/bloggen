My wife saw some art made by a style transfer AI for sale and said she wanted to buy it. I used a style transfer
AI to make a dissertation gift for a friend a couple of moths ago (using the CPU only), so I told her I wanted to give it a go first.
To do this I "needed" to install the latest stable version of Keras, TensorFlow, Cuda and cuCNN on the my old
stationary computer which has a decent GPU (for this purpose). It was MUCH easier than I remember it being. When I did this last
time (almost four years ago) when I had to resort to installing on a separate Ubuntu partition. You kids have it easy... =)
