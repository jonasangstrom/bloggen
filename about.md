I am a materials scientist/chemist and data scientist who is **looking for a new job** in or close to Uppsala. I have been programming Python for 5 years, especially for data analysis, machine learning and similar things. 

The main focus of my research has been metals, batteries and diffraction techniques. I have also worked with tomography and scaling up wet chemical synthesis.

Feel free to contact me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonasangstrom/) or via [email](mailto:jonas.aangstroem@gmail.com) with work opportunities.
